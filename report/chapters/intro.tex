%\textcolor{red}{What is the motivation to build your device? Why is this important (at least to you)?}
This report has been written by a group of students currently studying \textit{MSc in Computer Science} on the 2\textsuperscript{nd} semester. The report is the result of a seven-week project at the IT University of Copenhagen.
It has been written in connection with the course \textit{How To Make Almost Anything} with \textit{Andres Faina}.\\\\
We decided to build a desktop sized pinball machine as our final project. Our motivation for this project, apart from it being fun, was that work was easily distributed, since a pinball machine consists of several subcomponents and obstacles. Every subcomponents (popbumpers, flippers, switches) are independent of each other and offer different challenges in regards to electronics, mechanics, software and materials. Furthermore the scope of the project was easy to adjust due to its component divided nature.
