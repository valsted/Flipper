%What are the requirements or specifications? What are the capabilities that your device should have?
We were given two overall requirements for our project; the first was that the project had to contain electronics, mechanics and low level programming. The second requirement was that it had to be safe. Based on these requirements we decided on a minimum scope for our project that would make our pinball machine playable. Our minimum scope ended up including the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flippers (in the form of solenoids)
    \item Pop bumpers (in the form of solenoids)
    \item Targets with sensors (in the form of switches)
    \item A point system based on input from the different components/sensors 
    \item Display (to visualise the score)
\end{itemize}

We however ended up being ahead of time and we decided to expand the scope with the following components. We added the following components in order to make the game-play more exciting and challenging:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dividers at the top of the board (in the form of IR sensors)
    \item Visual outputs (in the form of LEDs and RGB LED strips)
    \item Mechanism to launch ball
    \item Mechanism to return ball to launch place including registration of a lost ball (IR sensor)
    \item Ramp and decorations
\end{itemize}
